# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, I created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

I did the following:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Performed feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use  `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separated the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tuned and compared at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* In the SVM model, the testing data's accuracy was 79.46%. In the Deep_Learning model, the testing data's accuracy was 84.49%. I tuned both of my models, hoping I could get closer to 85% or higher but did not get higher than the deep learning model. I still believe my deep learning model is good enough to predict new expoplants, if it is only wrong aroud 16% of the time. If I continued to train my model with an even larger data set or adjust how my training and testing data split - I think the accuracy would continue to rise.
